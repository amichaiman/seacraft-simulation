# Seacraft simulation

## Description
this program is a time-bound seacraft simultation.
the "world" is an unlimited sized sea.
objects in the sea can be
* Ports
* Cruisers (pirate ships)
* Freighters
* patrol boats

each time pulse is equivalent to one hour.
with each time pulse, all objects in sea are updated.

### Port
A port has a fixed position and fuel reservoir.
It's responisble to load unload and refuel seacrafts.
Each port has a fixed fuel production rate.
